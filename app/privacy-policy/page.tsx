                  Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (‚ÄúDNT‚Äù) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At

                <p>
                  We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot
                  verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided
