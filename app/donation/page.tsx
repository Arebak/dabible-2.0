                It is said, &quot;when God starts a thing, he speaks to His people.&quot;
                This is doubly so for me, because it was my encounter with Baba
                that bore the Dabible foundation. It was the 25th of March 2015.
                On this fateful day, I awoke from a shocking dream. I anxiously
                looked around but saw no one. After calming down, I thought back
                on the dream and the booming voice I heard saying, &quot;Build me a
                bible app&quot;.
              </p>

              <p>Half a year ago...</p>

              <p>
                Two weeks before arriving in the United States I got saved.
                Before this I lived an ungodly lifestyle; I was a drunk, a
                chronic womanizer, and most sickening of all were my fraudulent
                escapades. Thankfully I found salvation, and I was now starting
                my journey with the Lord. I must confess though that en route to
                the US, I had aimed to run my old ways; I assumed that I
                wouldn&apos;t need God anymore. I was keen on getting drunk and
                finding a lady to keep me company upon arrival. Later on, I
                would find myself a nice American chick to marry and set myself
                up for a good life in America.
              </p>

              <p>
                Fortunately, God had other plans for me. Upon arriving in the
                US, I stayed with a very hospitable family in Spokane,
                Washington. I slept in the guest house for a couple of days.
                During this time, I fervently studied Christianity. In fact, I
                especially studied the bible. I was hungry for the word of God.
                I found that I lost the urge to drink alcohol, and the once
                overwhelming lust for the opposite sex was now dulled. All I
                wanted now was to know more about God. So, I kept reading and
                learning with none but the holy spirit as my guide. This went on
                for six monthsâ€¦
