<p><strong><em>Then this app is what you need!&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p>No more falling asleep trying to listen to the KJV audio Bible you do not understand. This new app will keep you in suspense and transport you on a journey beyond time and space.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Hausa Audio Bible App simplifies all those complex words in the English Bible translation into something you can easily read and understand. Most importantly, it is FREE!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everything you read or hear is understood by converting it into a thinking language. Your thinking language is your native tongue. This is why it is difficult for many Africans to read the English KJV Bible, written in a language that is not our native tongue.</p>

<h2><strong>A Little Backstory</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 14th century, great men like William Tyndale, Martin Luther, John Wycliffe, and Thomas Cranmer faced bloody opposition to translating the Bible into the people's language. In this century, the idea is alive within us. It inspired the DaBible foundation to interpret the Bible in our native languages.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first project of our foundation was the free Yoruba Bible app with audio and text. The<a href="https://dabible.com/yoruba/">&nbsp;Yoruba Audio Bible App</a>&nbsp;was completed and released in March 2016. Our second project, the<a href="https://dabible.com/pidgin/">&nbsp;Pidgin Audio Bible App,</a>&nbsp;was released in December 2019. Another project we are a part of is the “<a href="https://dabible.com/solar-powered-audio-bible-player-for-the-elderly/">Solar Audio Bible for the Elderly</a>.” We are making solar portable devices that we will be giving out FREE to the older population in our villages and towns in Nigeria.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Why Make A Hausa Audio Bible App?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We at DaBible Foundation ultimately found out a large portion of Nigeria and some parts of Africa speak Hausa English but don’t have access to the Bible in Hausa. Many of these people can speak or read in Hausa but not English. We then decided to make the first complete Hausa Bible app with audio and text features. This app is now on both Google Play Store and the iOS store for free download.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The release of the Hausa app is also very personal for DaBible. We lost our dear brother Leviticus Makpa on May 21st to roaming bandits. He was a man who did everything for God till the end. He was a missionary who served with the Mission Field Evangelistic Outreach amongst the Kambari people in Tunga Maji, Rijau local government area of Niger state. This app is dedicated to his memory. You will be remembered for your great works Brother Levi.</p>
